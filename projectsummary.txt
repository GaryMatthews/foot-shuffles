Algoritm Goals:
-----------------------------
Increase stability
Increase stability in few steps


Brainstorm:
-----------------------------
Pareto optimum - min stability vs max stability
minimax
Pareto optima - max stability vs no. of steps


Problem Formulation:
-----------------------------
Let's formulate the problem as follows:
- We have some min stability which is acceptable. This is positive but near zero.
- We have some min stability which triggers a search for a better position.
- In this search we may not go below the minimum stability.

If the robot is unstable, let us say that it should seek satisfactory stability in the fewest steps
without becoming more unstable - if possible.


Plan: 
-----------------------------
Pick a suitable shuffle problem (one which is just below the threshold)
Use GlobalOptimization to find the global optima
Compare to fminunc
Compare to other global algorithms

Use the optimal solution as the benchmark

Run the optimization algo of choice with all step numbers and orders and build a pareto front to compare
step number with optimal stability given the constraints



Possible Future Plan:
----------------------------
Use pareto front to inspire a weighted fitness function


Algorithm
----------------------------
x Determine moveable legs which meet the threshold
Build all movesets of length n or shorter which are initially moveable
Initial condition is current placement
Optimize final stability with threshold constraint
Compare N step vs max stability pareto front
If exit flag is -2 then there is no solution
