FOOT SHUFFLE OPTIMIZER

Created by Tyler Morrison as an extension to Undergraduate Research
conducted at the University of Tulsa from 2016-2017.
- BRAT Lab
- Lab Director: Dr. Joshua Schultz

The work contained here was not quite enough for a journal article by
itself so it remains unpublished.

The example files contain examples that were used in the unpublished
manuscript and will be useful to anyone that seeks to use the code more.

I apologize in advance for the relatively poor documentation. This work was
conducted in my free time, and I often elected to do things quickly rather
than carefully.

"loadSubDirectories" should be executed before any of the functions can be
executed.
